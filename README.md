The information provided in this site will help you plan your travel to Turks and Caicos. As a first step please take a few moments and review the [Trip Planning](https://jeningolia.github.io/github-pages-with-jekyll/trip-planning/README.html) page and complete the RSVP form. Once we've confirmed your attendance and travel dates, we'll send you the registration form to book travel. When completing your registration, be sure to note any special travel arrangements (e.g. medical considerations, such as wheel chair accessibility, dietary requirements, etc.). 

Over the course of the next few weeks, we will provide updates on the detailed itinerary. You and a guest will be rewarded with a 4 night, 5 day stay at the Shore Club Hotel in Turks and Caicos, roundtrip airline tickets, your choice of one activity on the island and what we hope will be an unforgettable experience. Being a member of GitHub's Club19 is a true sign of an outstanding achievement so continue working hard and we look forward to celebrating your accomplishments in May!

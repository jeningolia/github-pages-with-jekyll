### Turks and Caicos Entry Requirements
Please log onto Egencia and [use this link](https://cibtvisas.com/?login=60005) to validate travel requirements for your trip to Turks & Caicos. It is imperative that you understand what documents are required for both you and your guest in order to enter Turks and Caicos and you are prepared with such documents upon arrival. If you have questions, please reach out as soon as possible. Here are the general guidelines:

* **Passports:** 
A valid passport is all that is required for citizens from Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, United States, France, Germany, and Australia to enter Turks and Caicos. It is important to note that most countries require visitors to hold a passport valid for at least six months beyond the date of country exit and with one blank page. 

* **Visas:**  It doesn't appear that any of the Hubbers who are attending will require a Visa, however, since we don't know the citizenship of the guests attending, please use the site above to verify entry requirements. 

## Planning Your Arrival and Departure Dates
Please read through the arrival and departure instructions below in detail. Youâ€™ll need to inform us of your desired arrival and departure dates. Once you have RSVP'd with your arrival and departure dates, we'll give you the specifics for booking your flights.

### Turks and Caicos Entry Requirements
Please log onto Egencia and [use this link](https://cibtvisas.com/?login=60005) to validate travel requirements for your trip to Turks & Caicos. Here are the general guidelines:

* **Passports:** 
A valid passport is all that is required for citizens from Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, United States, France, Germany, and Australia to enter Turks and Caicos. It is important to note that most countries require visitors to hold a passport valid for at least six months beyond the date of country exit and with one blank page. 

* **Visas:**  It doesn't appear that any of the Hubbers who are attending will require a Visa. Since we don't know the citizenship of the guests attending, please check the Visa site :point_up:.

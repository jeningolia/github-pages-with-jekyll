Have questions about Club? You've come to the right place.

**Q: Can I bring a guest?**
A: Yes! Each Hubber that qualifies for Club can bring one guest.

**Q: Can I come early or extend my trip?**
A: Yes, attendees who want to arrive early and/or depart late can do so at their own expense. When completing the RSVP form, please indicate your preferred arrival and departure dates. We will work directly with the hotel to coordinate your extended stay. Our negotiated hotel rates are good three days before and after the event and is subject to availability. Once availability has been confirmed, we will confirm the rate. (We have a couple of different negotiated rates based on room location).
